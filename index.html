<!-- TODO: Need to change the mobile height--it should be fixed not relative, i.e
it should be like 1200 px rather than 100vh, bc of phone sizes. This may or may not
make it easier to deal with the annoying bit about positioning... -->

        We all know that representation matters, this cannot be denied. In a society where media creates so much of how we feel about others, and ourselves, it matters absolutely. I write with the understanding that this story itself, its main characters and their actions, are largely unrealistic. That, however, is the point. How often does a black girl get the chance, in fiction, to be so unashamedly badass—for lack of a better term—without having to defend her race, her hair, her clothes, or any other thing about herself? How often is a woman of color given a chance to be the antihero? To define herself? Our definitions of good and evil are challenged these days in popular media by the growth of shows like Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy, where the lines of justice are drawn in spirals and dropped at random amongst characters with questionable morals. Yet, even in this intriguing landscape, women of color are still tied down to the same stories and the too tired tropes. It’s boring. I want to show young girls that they can choose how to define themselves, and they can shape their world—I don’t wish to tell them for what side.

        I got the idea for Selah, and the Spades. on the train home from work in November of 2012. I worked in IT at my alma mater and spent a lot of time devising ways to never work beneath fluorescent lights again. When I wasn’t doing that, I was writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a year, Selah, and the Spades. was just a short story about a girl leaning against a storefront while watching through binoculars as her second-in-command kicked a malcontent in the stomach for spreading rumors.  Early on in 2014 I turned the story into a short screenplay and it became a giant boulder that I dragged behind me. Ten pages of script that appeared out of nowhere and had no where to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I applied for a grant. I figured that the only way to write a feature was to work backwards: write about the characters like you knew them already; compose their lives like you’re recounting history; kill them off so that you can figure out what they were like when they lived.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, this summer, with the Leeway Foundation’s support, we’ve dedicated ourselves to exploring this story, this prelude to Selah, and the Spades.  It’s not perfect, but that’s good. If it were perfect, where would we be able to go with it? This project was an experiment in color, sound, grain, an experiment in every way. We sought mistakes so that we could learn more about the world of Pontomic, more about Maxxie, and Paloma, and Selah, and more about telling a story with this format, without paying money, and we did, we learned. And now we’re on draft four of the feature film.

        This overture is the scratch paper that you don’t turn in with your final Algebra exam, but when you’re proud of your work, what better way to celebrate than to share it with everyone. These vignettes do not follow one another linearly, it’s like a mix tape: they’re presented with theme and mood in mind. You can go through it from start to finish, skip around the chapters, take it up now, put it down, pick it up again later, it doesn’t matter. Enjoy it in the way that you can, and if you enjoy it, pass it along. Share the wealth.

Thank you to you all. All the readers and the editors and the “what if it went like this instead”ers and my madre and padre and the hermanos and ro and the leeway foundation. Thank you.
