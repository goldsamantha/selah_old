it should be like 1200 px rather than 100vh, bc of phone sizes. This may or may not

          Like if Sweet Valley High ran into The Godfather on the way to The Wire.
        </p>
      <p>
        My favorite book, since the first time I read it beneath the covers past bedtime in fifth grade, is a little known piece of fiction written by Fran Ross, <cite> Oreo</cite>.  It's this modern day odyssey of a biracial—
        black mom, white dad—girl whose strengths are in her multiplicity, her willingness to be this and that and then that too and this here and that over there, while never sacrificing one identity for the other. That book has always influenced the characters I seek to create: girls of color who are unapologetic in their volume, or their attitude. Who seek not make themselves easier to understand, because they already understand themselves, and do not consider it their job to teach others to understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
    As is strongly evident in all parts of <cite>Selah and the Spades</cite>, young women, and the roles placed upon them, are at the forefront of this deeply womanist story. I have no patience for a lack of diversity. I am not interested in continuing the system of “othering” the “other.” Teenage girls, especially girls of color, are so rarely given the opportunity to tell the everyday mumblecore stories that we experience, because we must busy ourselves with telling the world of our various struggles. I am not interested in that; we are so much more than we have been allowed to show. I was raised to be unapologetically black, unapologetically female, and unapologetically multitudinous in my being. This project seeks to contribute to the world of girls of color one of our own who isn’t made to feel ashamed of who she is, who has bad days, who does not smile, who unapologetically manipulates the world to her advantage.
  </p>
  <p>
    We all know that representation matters, this cannot be denied. In a society where media creates so much of how we feel about others, and ourselves, it matters absolutely. How often does a black girl get the chance, in fiction, to be so unashamedly wicked, without having to defend her race, her hair, her clothes, or any other superficial thing about herself? How often is a woman of color given a chance to be the anti-hero? To define herself? Our definitions of good and evil are challenged these days in popular media, where the lines of justice are drawn in spirals and dropped at random amongst characters with questionable morals. Yet, even in this intriguing landscape, people of color are still tied down to the same stories and the too tired tropes. It’s boring. This film seeks to show young girls of color that they can choose how to define themselves, and they can shape their world—it does not seek to tell them for what side.
  </p>
    <p>
    I first got the idea for <cite>Selah and the Spades</cite> on the train home from work in November of 2012. I worked in IT at my alma mater, Swarthmore College, and spent a lot of time devising ways to never work beneath fluorescent lights again. When I wasn’t doing that, I was writing.
    For a year, <cite>Selah and the Spades</cite> was just a short story about a black girl with a lot of hair and a streak of impatience leaning against a storefront while watching through binoculars as her second-in-command kicked a malcontent in the stomach for spreading rumors. Early on in 2014 I turned the story into a short screenplay and it became a giant boulder that I dragged behind me. Ten pages of script, workshopped at a Sundance Screenwriting Intensive in Philadelphia, that appeared out of nowhere and had no where to go.
</p>
<p>
    I figured that the best way to write a feature was to work backwards: write about the characters like you knew them already; compose their lives like you’re recounting history; kill them off so that you can figure out what they were like when they lived.
</p>
<p>

    And so, last summer, thanks to the Art and Change grant from the Leeway Foundation, I dedicated myself to exploring this story with the <cite>Overture</cite>. It’s not perfect, but that’s good. The <cite>Overture</cite> was an experiment in color, sound, grain, an experiment in every way. I sought mistakes so that I could learn more about the world of Pontomic, more about the characters, and more about telling stories. Without the <cite>Overture</cite> there'd be no <cite>Act I &amp; II</cite>.

Thank you to you all. All the readers and the editors and the “what if it went like this instead”ers and my madre and padre and the hermanos and ro and samantha and the leeway foundation. Thank you.
